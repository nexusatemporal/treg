"""The call-path breaker: the one sanctioned dataplane write of this domain.

A lock lives in ratestore as `capacity:lock:<key>` (`LOCK_NS`), a namespace the sweep never writes,
so a balance API that meters a different allowance than the one that ran out (a monthly meter
beside a daily cap) cannot undo it. The key is the provider for a balance signature (no money
serves nothing) and the endpoint id for a quota one (allowances are per operation: a search cap
says nothing about verifications). The row is a DB write on its own short session AFTER the
settle, never while an upstream request is in flight, and never raises: a lost write costs one
more relayed 402, not the call. Listed in `tests/test_call_architecture.py` as
`capacity_exhausted_mark`.

Open conservatively: a signature is a strike; the second strike within `STRIKE_WINDOW`, at least
`STRIKE_MIN_GAP` after the first (concurrent calls that hit the same instant are one strike), with
no 2xx in between, locks. Close eagerly: while locked, `probe_due` admits one real call per process
per `PROBE_EVERY_S`; that call's 2xx clears the lock (conditionally on the lock id it was admitted
under, so a late probe cannot erase a newer lock). Nothing else clears it except `until`: a guessed
hold lasts `DEFAULT_LOCK`, a vendor-stated reset at most `MAX_LOCK`.
